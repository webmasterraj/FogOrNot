Bad prediction today. Temperature difference says there should be fog, but there's not. The temp diff proxy isn't working. Time to figure out how to make my predictions better.

The first thing I thought of was adding another proxy variable to temperature difference: the amount of condensation nuclei in the air. It's possible that even thogh the temperature difference is right, fog isn't forming because there's not enough [condensation nuclei](http://starryskies.com/articles/2007/10/fog.html) in the air for water to condense on.

At first, data from personal air quality monitors, like Airbeam, looked promising. [Aircasting.org](http://www.aircasting.org) shows multiple locations across San Francisco where people are uploading air quality data. But these monitors measure pollution level particulate matter (2.5 - 10 microns), not [condensation nuclei]() size (0.1 microns). Also, I read a little further down that the condensation nuclei in places close to the ocean, like San Francisco, is usually salt. Which is always in the air. Still, Aircasting could an interesting data set, for another project on pollution.

What I really need instead of another proxy variable is a training data set. Some kind of record on historical fog conditions that I can map to the weather conditions I'm getting from the PWS's. So I looked at a few places:
- A record of fog conditions for the purposes of sea navigation. NOAA is a national agency for ocean and atmosphere. They have one weather station that specially measures visibility, but it's at Pier 17. Not much help for the western part of the city.
- The fog horns on the Golden Gate bridge are a great signal for fog. They only turn them on when there's fog, so a list of the times they've been turned on would be a great training data set. Unfortunately, the horns date from [1937](http://goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBFogHorn.php), and I seriously doubt if there's any log. (Did you know you could call [this number](http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/4183-everything-you-wanna-know-about-san-franciscos-foghorns) and hear a live recording of the foghorn? I wonder how many calls they get a day.)
- Sentiment analysis on Karl the Fog's Twitter timeline. Whoever maintains that generally writes positive things on foggy days, and negative things on sunny days. But text analysis isn't that cut and dry. I found a bunch of people tweeting at him with positive language in late September when that hot spell happened, because they missed him. So frequency isn't a good sign. Too bad, tweet sentiment analysis would have been really cool to do. But I don't think by itself it's a reliable enough signal.

Then it hit me: I've been looking for a data set with localized data, because in San Francisco, fog is a localized phenomenon. But I don't necessarily need to build my *model* with localized data. What if I just build it for one station where I have data on visibility as an independent variable (*cough* SFO airport *cough*). I can limit my dependent variables to ones that I can also get from personal weather stations, and then I can apply the same model across the city. 

I still want to think about this. But at least I know that building a learning algorithm is the way to go.
